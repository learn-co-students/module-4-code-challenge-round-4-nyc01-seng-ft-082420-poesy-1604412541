## Endpoints

The base URL for your backend is: http://localhost:6001

These are the routes you will need:

<!-- - GET `/poems` -->
- POST `/poems`
- DELETE `/poems/:id`

## Core Deliverables

As a user:

<!-- 1. When the app starts, I can see all currently created poems. -->

<!-- 2. I can show/hide the form to create new poems. -->

<!-- 3. I can create poems and they are still there when I refresh the page. -->

<!-- 4. I can mark poems as read which will change the text of that button to "Mark as unread". -->

## Advanced Deliverables

These deliverables are not required to pass the code challenge, but if you have the extra time, or even after the code challenge, they are a great way to stretch your skills.

> Note: If you are going to attempt these advanced deliverables, please be sure to have a working commit with all the Core Deliverables first!

As a user:

1. I can add a poem to my favourites and see it on a separate list.

2. I can delete a poem and they are still gone when I refresh the page.
